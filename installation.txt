To install, simply copy the files in the Edit Scripts folder to xEdit's Edit Scripts folder.

The Example Scripts folder has additional scripts you can copy into xEdit's Edit Scripts folder if you want to execute them.

The Documentation folder contains all the documentation you'll need to get started using MXPF to automate the creation of patches in xEdit.

Happy scripting!
