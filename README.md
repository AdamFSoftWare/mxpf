# Description
MXPF is an xEdit scripting library that provides a variety of functions
for the generation of patches.  Want to rebalance armor and weapons in 
Skyrim?  Done.  Apply a new particle effect to every weather?  Easy.  
Change the configuration of all NPCs?  Cake.

MXPF is comprised a suite of functions that do the work of finding the 
records you want to patch, identifying/creating a patch file, and 
copying records to the patch.  Where you would normally have to learn 
to do all of these steps yourself, with MXPF you can accomplish 
everything you need with a few simple functions.
